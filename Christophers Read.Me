# RPG Character System

## Project 2: Inheritance, Method Overriding, and Composition in Python

### 🧾 Overview

This project demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as:

* **Inheritance**: Creating specialized classes (e.g., Warrior, Mage, Rogue) that inherit from a base class (`Character`).
* **Method Overriding**: Ensuring specialized classes use their own versions of inherited methods (`attack`, `display_stats`).
* **Composition**: Using the `Weapon` class within `Character` to enhance combat capability.
* **Special Abilities**: Each subclass has unique abilities (e.g., `fireball`, `power_strike`, `sneak_attack`).

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python 3.12+
* Pytest (for unit testing)

### 🧩 Development Support

This project was completed with the assistance of modern development tools, which helped with:

* Debugging inheritance and override errors
* Improving class design and constructor structure
* Ensuring special abilities behaved as expected
* Fixing unit test issues and organizing code
* Generating basic documentation like this README

### 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Make sure you have Python and Pytest installed
3. Run the unit tests:

   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/
   ```
4. Optionally, run the script directly to test characters in action:

   ```bash
   python Christopher's_RPG.py
   ```

### 📚 Learning Takeaways

Through this project, I learned:

* How inheritance promotes cleaner code reuse
* The importance of properly overriding methods
* How to use composition to build more modular and maintainable classes
* The value of writing comprehensive tests for object behavior
